## Major Hurdles / Unsolved Problems
**Major Hurdles**
- Structuring and figuring out the location of each block of code was challenging.
- Fetching specific information from the API was the most challenging problem, after getting help and reading MDN documentation the issue was solved.
- Implementing a reset button was also a complication that eventually got solved with two different approaches: 
    - Creating a functional button. 
    - Using the initial submit button to clear the content. 
    The second approach was taken because it is user centric.

**Unsolved Problems**

 Ideally the “More Info” button should not duplicate the same information everytime is clicked, at the moment this happens if the user keeps clicking this button before checking for another movie and clicking the “Check it" (submit) button
